### What on Earth…?

You are Boris Boid. That's him over there. He's an *International Man of Ladies*.

### What's the goal?

As an *International Man of Ladies*, Boris is visiting the **Flamingo night club**—probably to pick up ladies. That's your goal:

**Move Boris around the club with the mouse.**

That way he can go check out the ladies (and dudes).

**Press the C key to Charm people.** They'll turn bright blue when attracted.

Bring attracted people to the dance floor! They'll party all night once you've brought them there. Careful, though, if you *move too fast* or *get too far away*, attracted people return to neutral. Boris can't win 'em all (at once…)

Also—these people aren't stupid. If you make them angry, they'll come after you. Angry people will **hurt Boris**, lowering the health bar above his head. The game is over when Boris gets knocked out!

**Press X to *Repel* people.**

This lets Boris give angry mobs the slip!
		
You can also press Z to *make things interesting*…Boris is going to be in for a world of hurt when you **insult** people nearby.
